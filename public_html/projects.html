			<li>the frompound [2021-present]: bought two old hosues on one lot, set them up to live with ~6 friends <a href="https://supernuclear.substack.com/about">supernuculearly</a>. approximately infinite subprojects, from moving walls to changing uncountable lightswitches to building 100' of shelving to snaking drains to ferreting out floor squeaks to painting. so much painting.</li>
